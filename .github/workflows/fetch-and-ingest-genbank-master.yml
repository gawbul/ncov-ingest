    # Currently, we aim to trigger ingest every day at 18:07 UTC which is 19:07 CET (as of Mar 2022).
    # Note the actual runs might be late. As of right now, the action starts around 20 past the hour.
    # Numerous people were confused, about that, including me:

    # Looks like you are about to modify this schedule? Make sure you also modify the schedule for the
    # sister GISAID job, so that we don't need to keep two schedules in our heads.
